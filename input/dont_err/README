This directory should contain files to be run by the `input_file_test_suite` in test.ml.

Tests should come in groups of related files:
- someTest.stile: the input program to be run
- someTest.options: if present, options for compiling and running the program, one word per line
  options are
  * "valgrind" to run the program with valgrind,
  * "no_builtins" to compile the program without any predefined native functions (like print or input)
  * "heap" followed by an integer to run the program with the given heap size (in words)
  * "alloc_strat" followed by either "naive" or "register" to tell the compiler
    which register-allocation strategy to use
- someTest.args: the command line arguments to use when running the program
  * note that if this file exists, the "heap" option above is ignored
- someTest.in: the (optional) input to your program

This will test that the program is *supposed* to fail to compile or run, but currently does not.
(Ideally, when your compiler works perfectly, this directory should be empty.  For now, it's better
to document which test cases aren't working as expected.)
